            Numerous transaction properties like beneficiary iban, amount details, create date, etc. are available for search.
          </p>

          <h4>Partner and merchant filters</h4>
          <p>
            Partners can be filtered out by entering at least three symbols in the partner field. Then if matched partners are found, 
            select one from the list.
          </p>

          <p>
            Merchant field is initially disabled. It needs a partner to be selected before it enables. 
            Searching this field is as is the partner search.

           <p>
            You can export transactions by clicking the export button on the search transactions screen. 
            The export will take into consideration the current search criteria and export accordingly.
          </p>

           <h4>Import transactions</h4>
           <p>
            There is a functionality to import transaction from a XML file. 
            Since the file itself does not contain information about the partner and the merchant it is thus required to 
            fill in the partner and merchant information on the search screen before you can click the import button.
