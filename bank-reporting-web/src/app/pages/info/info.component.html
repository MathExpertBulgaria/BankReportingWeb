          <h4>Search transactions</h4>
          <p>
            You can search transactions by numerous transaction properties like beneficiary iban, amount details, create date, etc. 
            You can also search all transactions by not specifying any criteria.
          </p>
           <p>
           After searching you are displayed the search result in a sortable table with pagination.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can reset the search by clicking on the reset button.
          </p>

          <h4>Partner and merchant filters</h4>
          <p>
            Partners can be filtered out by entering at least three symbols in the partner field. Then if matched partners are found, 
            select one from the list. The list may contain only a few of the matched records, so use the export functionality to 
            be more specific about the partner name.
          </p>

          <p>
            Merchant field is initially disabled. It needs a partner to be selected before it enables. 
            Searching this field is as is the partner search.
          </p>

           <h4>Export transactions</h4>
           <p>
            You can export transactions by clicking the export button on the search transactions screen. 
            The export will take into consideration the current search criteria and export accordingly.
          </p>

           <h4>Import transactions</h4>
           <p>
            There is a functionality to import transaction from an XML file. 
            Since the file itself does not contain information about the partner and the merchant it is thus required to 
            fill in the partner and merchant information on the search screen.
